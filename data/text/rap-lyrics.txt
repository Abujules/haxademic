Ice Cube
Today Was a Good Day

Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God 
I don't know but today seems kinda odd 
No barking from the dogs, no smog 
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog 
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out 
Finally got a call from a girl wanna dig out 
Hooked it up on later as I hit the do' 
Thinking will i live, another twenty-fo' 
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top 
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop 
Had to stop at a red light 
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight 
And everything is alright 
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night 
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all 
Which court, are y'all playin basketball? 
Get me on the court and I'm trouble 
Last week fucked around and got a triple double 
Freaking brothers everyway like M.J. 
I can't believe, today was a good day 

Drove to the pad and hit the showers 
Didn't even get no static from the cowards 
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me 
Saw the police and they rolled right past me 
No flexin, didn't even look in a niggaz direction 
As I ran the intersection 
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps 
What's the haps on the craps 
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em 
Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em 
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven 
Seven even back do lil Joe 
I picked up the cash flow 
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino 
And now i am yelling dominoes 
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A. 
Today was a good day 

Left my niggaz house paid 
Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the twelve grade 
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic 
The Lakers beat the Supersonics 
I felt on the big fat fanny 
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny 
And my dick runs deep so deep so deep 
Put her ass to sleep 
Woke her up around one 
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun 
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting 
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion 
I was glad everything had worked out 
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out 
Today was like one of those fly dreams 
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams 
No helicopter looking for a murder 
Two in the morning got the fat burger 
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp 
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp 
Drunk as hell but no throwing up 
Half way home and my pager still blowing up 
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K. 
I got to say it was a good day. 

Hey wait, wait a minute fool 
Stop the shit 
What the fuck am I thinking about?

Lil Kim
Queen Bitch

If peter piper pecked em, I betcha biggie bust em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically, I dust em, off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers, bitch with that platinum grammer
I am a diamond cluster hustler
Queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch
Murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease free bitch
Check it, I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A. remember them?
Tell em when I used to mess with gentlemen
Straight up apostles, now strictly niggaz that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better, Beretta inside of Beretta
Nobody do it better
Bet I wet cha like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eatin my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, this rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggaz lives for one point five
While you struggle and strive we pick which Benz to drive
The M.A.F.I.A. you wanna be em
Most of y'all niggaz can't eat without per diem
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch

Uhh, who you lovin who you wanna be huggin
Roll with niggaz that be thuggin, buggin
In the tunnel in Eso's

On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moscino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
C-note after C-note, Frank Bo hold fifteen plus the caterer
You think you greater, uh
(You niggaz got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch)
Check my pitch, or send it persona
And I'll still stick your moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good ass shot
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sippin Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shop in Bloomingdales for Prada bags
Female Don Dada hats no problems spittin cream with my team
Shit's straight like nine fifteen, y'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossin my Rolex wrist
Shit, I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch






Notorious B.I.G.
Gimme the Loot

Yeah. Motherfuckers better know... huh, huh. Lock your windows,
close your doors. Biggie Smalls, huh...yeah.


My man Inf left a Tec and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?

Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
and I'm stressed, yo Biggie let me get the vest

No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckers since the slave ships
with the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
have his mother singing "It's so hard..."

Yes, love love you're fucking attitude
because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed
and bruised up from the pistol whipping
webs on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 MOM pendant

I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'cos Mom Duke ain't giving me shit
so for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking Angel Dust
When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
and I'm shooting niggas quick if you hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece
The opposite of peace sending Mom Duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'cos when I lick shots the shits is persistent

Huh, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
from the main thug, .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got an itchy one grip

One in the chamber, 32 in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel
before you find out how blue steel feel

from the Beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better
Rolex watches and colourful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it

Man, niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get stripped down for they earrings and bangles
and when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant "baka! baka! baka!"

So go get your man bitch he can get robbed too

Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?

I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
and if I said it the cocksucker won't forget it

Man, listen all this walking is hurting my feet
But money looks sweet (where at?) in the Isuzu jeep

Man, I throw him in the Beem, you grab the fucking C.R.E.A.M
and if he start to scream "bam! bam!", have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar

Ooh Biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat...

Yo chill, Shorty, let me do that...
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked, getting shot on the spot
(Oh shit! The cops!) Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
(So why the fuck he keep looking?) I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass 'cos I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, 'cos I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot





Le1f
Soda

I came thru with a dip
Made them girls say 'kat kat'
Serving up some clicks
Might as well been a gat
If you're with your clique
Then show me where your at
If you ain't the shit
Kitty cat, fall back

I'm sippin' and dippin' now it's your lips that you're lickin'
I got you lovin' and buggin' cuz I'm sparkling. I'm sparkling
It's my soda pop, biatch. Fizzle, fall back if you not with it
If you is then get it. Pop it let it drip like a faucet
Paint them a portrait with your chocolate ice cream soda potion
I'm foamy for sure; real slick with the motions
Check the motions of my ocean


She think she a cool cat but she don’t like the water
Step up to my ocean and dip it with the daughters
We wavy with the waves; make you slave to the rhythm
Get emancipated. Put the serum in your system
She think she a cool cat but she don’t like the water
Step up to my ocean and dip it with the daughters
We wavy with the waves; make you slave to the rhythm
Get emancipated. Put the serum in your system





Ludacris
My chick bad

My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff dat ya chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My my chick bad, badder than yours
My my my chick bad, badder than yours

I’m saying my chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My chick do stuff that I can’t even put in words
Her swagger don’t stop
Her body won’t quit
So fool pipe down you ain’t talkin bout shit
My chick bad, tell me if you seen her
She always bring the racket like Venus and Serena
All white top, all white belt
And all white jeans, body looking like milk
No time for games, she’s full grown
My chick bad, tell your chick to go home

Now your girl might be sick but my girl sicker
She rides that dick and she handles her liquor
She knock a bitch out and fight
Coming out swinging like Tiger Woods wife
Yeah she could get a little hasty
Chicks better cover up there chests like pasty’s
Couple girl friends and they all a little crazy
Coming down the street like a parade Macy’s
I fill her up balloons
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
Doh, but I aint talkin bout homer
Chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her

Yo, now all these bitches wanna try and be my bestie
But I take a left and leave them hanging like a testi
Trash talk to em then I put em in a hefty
Running down the court I'm dunkin on em Lisa Leslie.
It’s going down, basement, friday the 13th guess who’s playing Jason
Tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy
It’s nightmare on Elm street and guess who’s playing Freddy
(My chick bad)
Chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy
The mental Asylum looking for me
You a rookie to me
I’m in dat wam bam purple Lam’ damn bitch you been a fan.







Warren G
Regulate


It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Just rolling in my ride, chilling all alone

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3

So I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis
Some brothers shooting dice so I said "let's do this"
I jumped out the ride and said "what's up?"
Some brothers pulled some Gats, so I said "I'm stuck"

Since these girls peeping me, I'mma glide and swerve
These hookers looking so hard they straight hit the curb
On to big better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm getting jacked, I'm breaking myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said "damn, what's next?"

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound-for-pound
I've got to come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They've got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happening in my own town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

16 in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they dropping and yelling
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down, I let my Gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak-mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks, and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me: the Warren to the G

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ooh, I like your size
She said my car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords, strings, we brings
Melody, G-Funk:
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm





Dizzee Rascal
I Luv U


Yo If that girl knows where you stay that's poor
Some whore banging on your door what for
Pregnant? What're you talking about, be sure
Fifteen, she's underage, that's raw
And against law 5 years or more
And she wants a score and half of a draw
That's the kind of threat that you can't ignore
That whore got you pinned down to the floor
But it's your own fault, you said three magic words (I love you)
When that's the one for the birds
When you said that she forgot other boys
It's over, you better start buying the toys
There was no intention of her being wife
Now she knows this she's ending your life
It's a real shame you got had by the whores
It's a shame that kid probably ain't yours

That girl' some bitch ya know
She keep calling my phone
She don't leave me alone
She just moan and groan
She just keep ringin' me at home
These days I don't answer my phone
That boy' some prick you kna'
All up in my hair
Thinks that I care
Keeps following me here
Keeps following me there
These days I can't go nowhere
Ain't that your girl
Nah it ain't my girl
I swear that's your girl
Course it ain't my girl
She got juiced up
Oh well
She got jacked up
Oh well!
I swear that's your man
I ain't got no man
You was with that man
He was just ANY man
He got hotted up
Oh well
He got whacked up
Oh well!

Alright, she's a bad girl, I'm a boss though
Captain Roscoe with a crossbow
She came she got picked off yo
Nah its not a love ting, get lost ho
Dizzee Rascal come down like snow
With freezing cold flows like Moscow
Dumb ho, get me upset, guns blow
Bitch, you're not ready for skid row
Bleed know Dizzee Rascal did grow
Big feet for the force on my big toe
I got no chaps, no chains, not much dough
Get juiced but you don't get love though
No slap but you might get a co-co
Jambo coming through like Rambo
Love ting takes two like tango
But she ain't my wifey, she can go

Listen, I like your girl so you better look after your girl
Or I might just take your girl and make your girl my girl
Switch your girl with Michelle
Switch Michelle with Chantelle
Play Chantelle with Shanell
Lyrical clientele but I ain't a bow cat, I don't like the smell
I'm gonna go through a shell and make a boy feel unwell
That girl's from school, that girl's from college
That girl gives brains, that girl gives knowledge
That girl gives head, that girl gives shines
That girl gives bj's at all times
She looks decent, she looks fine
But don't talk about wifey she's not mine
She got batches, 6 in a line, believe me that's not a good sign

Uh, Dizzee Rascal
Roll Deep, it's all love, ha ha
2000 and slew, get me
Damn right I'm articulate, I'm not an idiot
Dem boy not ready yet, trend they could never set
This is the next step
I write the 2-step
Niggas better get set
I'll make your girl wet

Hey, I can be the answer

And when I hit that dip get your camera
You can see I been that bitch since the pamper
And that I am that young sis the beacon
The bitch who wants to compete and

You know what your bitch become when her weave in
I just wanna sip that punch with your peeps and
Sit in that lunch if you're treatin'
Kick it with the bitch who comes from Parisian
She know where I get mine from and the season
Now she wanna lick my plum in the evenin'
And fit that tongue tongue d-deep in

Wu-Tang Clan
Bring Da Ruckus

Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang
could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style

Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus

Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse
My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin terror, quick damage ya whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hittin sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down
A literate type asshole, songs goin gold, no doubt
and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that
Carryin gats but yo, my Clan
Rollin like forty Macs
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo sewwwwwwwww, represent
I wait for one to act up
Now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin
Bust this, I'm kickin like Segall, Out for Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga
So bad, stabbin up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on ya ass like your dad, bring it on...

Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin through ya back *swish*
Givin bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin CREAM, I ain't wettin fame
Who sellin gain, I'm givin out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin ruckus...

So bring it on...







Kool Keith
Plastic World


I left new york, the city itself was stress depression
High boots and urban beats, that wasn’t my direction
Producers filtering join in with r&b
A million rappers, some clones trying to sound like me
Biting my space styles, biting my horror-core
All I saw was kool keiths on my thaw
Record companies had g’d-off all my royalties
Watching vinyl spin, local groups’ wack mc’s
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap
Karl kani jeans, fat stomachs in the limosines
Mixtapes by wack dj’s adds doo doo play
I’m on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway
Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion
On videos out of town, peoples buy confusion
Rolling high with cash pulled over down my eye
Since I’ve been out, y’all can’t see

Is the world made of plastic? 
Is the city buried in dreams? (yeah)
Is the world made of plastic? 
Cause that’s the way is seems (owww)

Watching tv so bored, while imbiciles hold the mic cord
Graffiti playgrounds are played out, yo how’d that sound? 
Army fatigues are weak, is for the minor leagues
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented benz
Crews on stage, acting hard with a thousand friends
I saw the place turn plastic, crackers looping beats
People with no deals, walkmen rappin on the streets
I turned my back, 90% of the city sounded wack
Payola scams switched dj’s like a rubber band
Everybody clear with beats trying to be premier
Clearing samples, your sp-12 fake examples
My money grows with green from my own label
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label
Your tri-state ways are shut down by barricades
In fact I packed my bags, and listened to e-40
Mac mall, c-bo, and other rappers you don’t know
You’re narrow-minded and styles of mind you won’t find it
My sound proceeds with moog and undertone bass
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face
I come back real, solid rock razor steel
Tap your program, show the world I’m the man
You copy poppa large, the industry is large

As I do see sorta rugged wack beer commercials
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the ninja turtles
From manhattan I heat up, yo light up times square
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare
No promotional shows, girls wear corn rows
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes
I walk with straw hats, fake glasses in the projects
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage
Playing my numbers, waiting for the five to come
Spaghetti out the window, people acting dumb
Fire hazards wake the neighbors, your family’s nosy
I come and go as I please on blockhead mc’s
You bought new sneakers, no car, scrambling on the corner
I’m not the star you are, the city’s fallen far
By mechanism, you’re on my tip
Stay off my penis, you’ve duplicated me for years

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are the one







Dr Dre. 
Let Me Ride

Creepin' down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked, cause niggas want these
But no soon as I said it
Seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9, tryin' to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call
My niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off
Motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rollin' in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clockin' all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfuckin' D.R.E
From the C.P.T
On a ryhmin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to POP, POP, POP
Yeah cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another stop

Cause I'm rollin' in my 6-4
With all the niggas, sayin'

Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and
Let me ride

It's just another motherfucking
Day for Dre, so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists
It's just that
Gangster glare
With gangster raps
That gangster shit
Makes a gang of snaps
Word to the muthafuckin' streets
And word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit ya with
That I get ya with
As I groove in my '4 on D's
Hittin' the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker and I'm about to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip, a nigga trip to the south side

Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip
Now I'm just flossin'
Checking my rearview
Cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 211
Fuck around and get caught up in a 187
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynchin'
But I just watch them hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peeping out they window when they hear me beating up the street
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say
Every single muthafuckin day
But I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it
While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin'
I be rollin' in my 6-4
