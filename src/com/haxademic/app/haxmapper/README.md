### HaxMapper

A custom projection-mapped visual system

#### TODO

* Texture manager to distribute textures between groups and group items
	* Different modes to:
		* Switch all to one particular mode
		* Make a distribution across group
		* Randomly switch textures on beat
* Add UDP messages into group management
	* Average color for each structure
	* Use tringle centroid to get color from each mapped polygon
* Build wireframe animations
	* Actual bars between points. Don't add line data twice for overlapping polygon sides!
	* Auido-reactive points between vertices
* More textures!! 
	* convert existing element/modules from HaxVisual
	* add more shaders
	* Add a wiping texture
	* Cohesive color scheme??
* Cleanup
	* Tighten up the mapping modes of rects and triangles
