### HaxMapper

A custom projection-mapped visual system

---

### Live gear required:

* Computer & power cord
* Tripod 
* Ratchet straps
* Audio cables & dongle for input & XLR long cables & connectors
* Extension power cords
* Video cables
* Projector(s)
* iPad
* Wireless router
* Crates for airflow?


## ToDo:

* Solve performance issues...
* Refactor new MeshLines modes into a better system
* MORE TEXTURES
* Allow dragging polygons in HaxMapper for realtime adjustments?
* Add adjustable speed throttling properties to speed/slow the rate at which program changes happen - use adjustable modulos
* Use solid colors vs. using any alpha, since this is faster


#### Texture manager to distribute textures between groups and group items* 
* sweeping/traversing 
 		
#### Build wireframe animations

* Audio-reactive points between vertices
* Triangle moving from polygon to polygon
* Particle system flying around vertices

#### More textures
* convert existing element/modules from HaxVisual
* add more shaders
* Add a wiping texture
* Kinect textures
* perf - figure out what slows the program down
* mesh line mode: fade random polygon on the beat
* another basic eq mode with vertices instead of bars
* post-processing effects?? / occasional crazy shit with the camera?
* vertex displacement
* More post-processing
* Concave hull to draw around the outer edge and mask the interior


#### Cleanup
* Subdivide quads for less distortion
