### HaxMapper

A custom projection-mapped visual system

---

### Live gear required:

* Computer & power cord
* Tripod 
* Ratchet straps
* Audio cables & dongle for input
* Extension power cords
* Video cables
* projector(s)
* iPad
* Wireless router


## ToDo:

---

#### Next:

* Test Minim on basic EQ and make sure gain change is good 
* Add methods to creatively distrubte updates to polygons and meshlines in a group
* Add a mode for polygons to take a color and be a simple audio-reactive panel - good for small triangles when there's not enough room for textures
* Beat detection test! make a test app for this.
* setActive on video addition / removal from pool to stop playing
* Convert to minim!

#### Texture manager to distribute textures between groups and group items* 

* Switch all to one particular mode
* Make a distribution across group
* Randomly switch textures on beat
* all polygons in a group switch to a new texture, then start swapping
* all polygons in a group switch to differet rotations or modes
* groups add & remove textures as time goes on
* sweeping/traversing 
* all textures should null out and slowly come back in as the wireframes/overlays take focus
* Reset all properties/rotation of polygons
* Set rotation & mapping mode of polygons manually
* Groups should control wireframes as well as polygons
 
		
#### Add UDP messages into group management
* Average color for each structure
* Use tringle centroid to get color from each mapped polygon

#### Build wireframe animations

* Audio-reactive points between vertices
* Triangle moving from polygon to polygon
* Particle system flying around vertices

#### More textures!! 
* Super simple alpha color panel to audio - add more instances to texture pool
* convert existing element/modules from HaxVisual
* add more shaders
* Add a wiping texture
* Kinect textures

#### Cleanup
* Break up content between the 2 nights
* Tighten up the mapping modes of rects and triangles
* Subdivide quads for less distortion
* More cohesive color scheme??

#### Testing!
* Stress test with more triangles!!!!! Especially for audio-reactive waveform mesh



#### Nice-to-have
* Concave hull to draw around the outer edge and mask the interior
* More final post-processing


#### Add Videos for night 1
